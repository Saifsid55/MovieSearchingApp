3. Architecture Overview
MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel): The app follows the MVVM design pattern, where:

Model: Represents the data and business logic of the app. It includes the structures that define the appâ€™s data (e.g., Movie, Detail).

View: The UI components that present the data to the user. The views are responsible for rendering the UI elements and receiving user input (e.g., HomeViewController, MovieDetailViewController, MovieCVC). In this architecture, the views bind to the ViewModel to display data.

ViewModel: Acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. It retrieves data from the Model, processes it as needed, and then exposes it in a form that the View can easily use. The ViewModel also handles any UI logic that doesn't belong to the View itself, like managing the state of loading indicators (e.g., HomeViewModel, MovieDetailViewModel).
